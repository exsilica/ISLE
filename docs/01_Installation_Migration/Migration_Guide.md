##### Migrate an Existing Islandora Environment to ISLE

This Migration guide will help you migrate your existing production Islandora environment to utilize this ISLE framework for easily maintaining Islandora. This guide will walk you through how to identify and copy your institution's Islandora data and files (including your data volume, Drupal site or sites, and commonly customized xml and xslt files) to your ISLE framework.


Prerequisites:

1. Host Server set up according to the [instructions](../00Host_Server/Host_Server_Setup.md)

1. Have a domain name that works - is set up with DNS etc...

1. Have SSL Certificates for the domain

1. ISLE project has been cloned to BOTH your local laptop/workstation AND the host server - see [Setup Guide](../00Host_Server/Host_Server_Setup)

2. Disk space on or mounted to the Host Server large enough to store a **copy** of your fedora data store

2. Access to that server from your local workstation via SSH (`islandora` user with sudo privileges)

3. Access to the current Islandora production server

4. Usernames/Passwords for key parts of your stack which are used **for** the migration.
    * Drupal SQL information: username, password, database name can be obtained from your original `www/sites/default/settings.php`
    * Fedora SQL information: username, password, database name can be obtained from your original `fedora/server/config/fedora.fcfcg`
    * Fedora users: please have a copy of your `fedora-users.xml`
    * Tomcat users: please have a copy of your `tomcat-users.xml` OR use the default login: admin,ild_tc_adm_2018 (for both fedora and solr)

5. SQL dump (export) of the current production site's Drupal database


--------------------

## Overview of steps

*tl;dr* Copy old stuff over to host server w/ checklist, create new private repo for configs, merge old configs into new configs w/ checklist, edit docker-compose.yml to point to new configs, spin up containers, go into fedora container & reindex, qc site - Done.

- **COPY** the drupal/islandora site and configuration files from the running production Islandora (there's a checklist)

- create a new directory for the /config folders and files, copy the ISLE repository /config into it, and make this into a private repository

- following the steps in this document, edit the /config files so they have the proper site-specific information (there's a checklist for this too!)

-  **NOTE** some of this will involve fairly complicated merging of files to account for custom edits that may have been made to your production Islandora site and/or to bring configuration files up to work with newer software versions. This is by far the trickiest part of the migration and definitely a good place to seek help from the community if you get stuck.

- Edit the docker-compose.yml file to point to all these fine new config files.
- Download ISLE images from Dockerhub and spin up the ISLE Containers (takes a while depending on network speeds)
- go into the fedora container and do re-index (takes a little while)
- go to the new site and QC!

-------------------

## Detailed Steps

* Setup a Private Code Repository
      * Most of the work in this guide involves careful editing of the various configuration and settings files that customize the pieces of Islandora (database, repository, web-server, etc...).
      * Doing this work in a code repository makes it easier to correct errors and to repeat the process for additional servers without needing to replicate all the work.
      * Since the edits will include things like passwords, it's important to make this a private repository.

* Customizing for your Environment
      * Many of the steps below describe adding the domain name or other specific bits of information into files or appending those bits to file names.
      * In these cases this guide will call out the customization point AND provide an example - it's important not to literally copy paste the example!
      * Your best guide for these customizations are the source files from your currently running Islandora environment.

## Create Private Code Repository

**ON your local laptop/workstation:**

* On the repository of your choice (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) create a PRIVATE remote git repo - see the specific code repository documentation online for setup instructions.

* Open a terminal - navigate to /opt/ISLE or where you put the ISLE directory on your local workstation.

* Create a directory named yourdomainconfig (where "yourdomain" is your server domain name)

example:  `digital-collectionsconfig`

* Locate the directory called `config` and copy all the contents to the newly created directory

* `cd` into the newly copied and renamed yourdomainconfig directory and type:
 `git init` to initate this directory as a code repository.

* `git remote add NameOfYourRepository URLofYourRepository` to connect your local repository to the remote you set up in the above steps. [**NOTE** replace "NameOfYourRepository" and "URLofYourRepository" with the name of your repository and its URL]

* You are now ready to perform the customization edits in this directory (you can use a text editor of choice now don't have to stay in terminal - just locate the folder in the finder and open file in text editor)

-------

## Migration Export checklist

In this section you'll follow a checklist of materials to **COPY** from the current running institutional Islandora Production server(s) to your working directories on the local workstation.

* in the same /opt/ISLE directory create a new sub-directory (you can call this `current-production-config`)

* copy the files from your current live system into this directory as directed in the [Migration Export Checklist](/docs/01_Installation_Migration/migration_export_checklist.md) 







##Edits

---------
Now proceed to edits within the child directories, make appropriate edits to config files:

a. to reflect **environment** (prod, stage, dev, etc...)

b. to involve your **domain name** (digital-collections.example.edu)

----------
##Apache directory

* Copy your SSL certificates for Apache into `apache/ssl/certs`

* Within the `sites-available` directory, rename the files isle_localdomain_ssl.conf and isle_localdomain.conf to your domain names  example:

    `digital-collections.example.edu_ssl.conf`
    `digital-collections.example.edu.conf`

* edit the  `yourdomain_ssl.conf` file change lines 12 and 13 to point to the location of your certs - example:

        `SSLCertificateFile    /certs/ssl-cert-example.pem`
        `SSLCertificateKeyFile /certs/ssl-cert-example.key`

* edit the file: `settings.php`   lines 251-253 add your database name, database user, and database password    

* edit the file: `settings.php`   line 288 to include a 45+ alpha-numeric characters drupal hash between the quotes after this text: `$drupal_hash_salt = '';`

* review the file: `settings.php`  near line 311 to ensure `# $base_url = ` is commented out

* edit the file: `apache_provision.sh`  line 47:

`/usr/local/bin/drush site-install -y --account-name=isle_localdomain_admin --account-pass=isle_localdomain_adminpw2018 --account-mail=admin@isle.localdomain --site-name=“ISLE.localdomain”`

Change the following in this line to the appropriate names and passwords for your site

    account name
    account-pass
    account-mail
    site-name

----------
##Fedora directory

* Within the fedora/fedora directories, **change the passwords** in the following files:

          fedora-users.xml  (change all applicable)
          fedora.fsfg  (line numbers see below)
          filter-drupal.xml  (change db name, db user, db psswd)

* within the `gsearch` directory, edit the file: `fedoragsearch.properties` at line 7 add a space after the equal sign and add the fgsAdmin password

` -  fedoragsearch.soapPass                =`

* Edit the file: `fgsconfig-basic-configForIslandora.properties`  line 26: edit the gsearch password

`gsearchPass=ild_fgs_admin_2018`

* in the same file edit line 67 edit the fedora password

`fedoraPass=ild_fed_admin_2018`

* Edit the file: `fedora/gsearch/fgsconfigObjects.properties` line 15: edit the fedora admin password

`fgsconfigObjects.fedoraPass            = ild_fed_admin_2018`

* Edit the file: `fedora/gsearch/repository.properties` line 7: edit the fedora admin password

`fgsrepository.fedoraPass        = ild_fed_admin_2018`

---------
##Tomcat directory

* Within the **tomcat** sub directories:

 Strongly recommend changing tomcat user passwords in file: `fedora/tomcat/tomcat-users.xml`

 ONLY CHANGE TOMCAT USERNAME/PASSWORD - looks like this:

          <!-- user manager can access only manager section -->
             <user username=“manager” password=“ild_tc_man_2018" roles=“manager-gui” />  <!--enduser please add passwords / users and remove this comment -->

          <!-- user admin can access manager and admin section both -->
             <user username=“admin” password=“ild_tc_adm_2018” roles=“manager-gui,admin-gui” /> <!--enduser please add passwords / users and remove this comment -->

          </tomcat-users>

----------

##Repository policies

Edit the contents of the repository-policies directory as necessary IF YOU NEED TO otherwise leave alone.

------

##Mysql directory

* edit the contents of `create_drupal_user.sql` to create the drupal site db user

* edit the contents of `create_fedora_user.sql` to create the fedora db user

* edit the contents of `fedora3.sql` to create the fedora db

* edit the contents of `site.sql` to create the drupal site db

* make any appropriate edits as you see fit to `my.conf` IF NEEDED

 -------

##Proxy directory

* in the `config/sites-enabled` directory, rename the `conf` file to `yourdomain.conf` (where "yourdomain" is the domain name of your server)
  * for example: `digital-collections.example.edu.conf`

* Now edit the file...

    * change line 6 `server_name` to `yourdomainname` (where "yourdomain" is the domain name of your server)
    * change line 15 `server_name` to `yourdomainname` (where "yourdomain" is the domain name of your server)
    * change lines 18 and 19 to the name of your ssl certs (should be same names as in apache edits above)
    * edit lines 36 and 37 - uncomment: `ssl_stapling on;` and uncomment: `ssl_stapling_verify on;`
    * uncomment line 40:  `add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=15768000;`

    * append your environment type (prod, dev, stage, etc.) to the following lines proceeded by a hyphen i.e. `-dev`

----------
##SSL-certs directory
Copy your SSL certs into the ssl-certs dir
DO NOT OVERWRITE OR DELETE the dhparam.pem file that's in There
--------

##upstreams.d directory

* copy and rename: `sample-upstreams.conf.disabled` - replace "sample" in the file name w/ the environment name e.g. (dev, prod, stage, etc...)

* lines 10 and 14 look like this:

        upstream fedora-internal {
          server fedora:8080 fail_timeout=0;
        }

        upstream apache-internal {
          server apache:443 fail_timeout=0;
        }

* Append the environment name after  both instances of "internal" proceeded by a hyphen "-dev" in this example:

          upstream fedora-internal-dev {
          server fedora:8080 fail_timeout=0;
        }

        upstream apache-internal-dev {
          server apache:443 fail_timeout=0;
        }

-----

##Solr directory

* Within the tomcat sub-directories

Strongly rec you change tomcat user passwords in file: `fedora/tomcat/tomcat-users.xml`

**ONLY CHANGE TOMCAT PASSWORD**

looks like this:

      <!-- user manager can access only manager section -->
         <user username=“manager” password=“ild_tc_man_2018" roles=“manager-gui” />  <!--enduser please add passwords / users and remove this comment -->

      <!-- user admin can access manager and admin section both -->
         <user username=“admin” password=“ild_tc_adm_2018” roles=“manager-gui,admin-gui” /> <!--enduser please add passwords / users and remove this comment -->

      </tomcat-users>

--------

##Docker compose file:

* Edit the file: **docker-compose.yml** accordingly:

      * Change container names based on the environment (prod, stage, dev, etc)

      * For example if you are building a dev server instance:

  `container_name: isle-solr`

  changes to:

  `container_name: isle-solr-dev`

and so on...



--------


##Final steps

* Now that all the changes are made (be sure to save), ISLE should be ready to test. First you'll need to push these changes to your private code repository.

    * Open a terminal - `cd` to the config directory you've been making the changes in...

    * `git status`  this will show you all the files that have been modified and ready to be added to your private repo along with handy paths for the next steps.

    * `git add /pathtoyourmodifiedfile` (replace "pathtoyourmodifiedfile" with the path to your config directory)

    * run these:

    `git add apache`
    `git add fedora`
    `git add mysql`
    `git add proxy`
    `git add solr`
    `git add docker-compose.yml`

    * run `git status` again - everything should be in green now as all modified files have been added - if anything's still red use git add and the path to add it

    * then run `git commit -m "initial config commit"` inside the double quotes is the commit message you can say whatever you want in this message - so for example if this is the config for your dev instance you could say that...

    * run `git push origin master` this will push all your changes to the repo further changes should be made on branches for different servers or to master branch for this same server


--------

##Clone Custom Configuration to Host Server

* Open a terminal - ssh into your host server using the `islandora` user

* `cd` to `/opt/ISLE/config/`

* because your customizations are in a **private** repository, you'll need to add this islandora user's `id_rsa.pub` key to the repository via the website.

* This key is found in `/home/islandora/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

* One can simply run `cat /home/islandora/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and copy the output (ensure no whitespaces or extra returns)

* Go to the repository web site with a browser and locate your private repository.

      * locate the ssh key entry location (in Bitbucket this is in Settings / Access Keys /
      * **add** an ssh key w/ the label **islandora host server** paste in the key text and click **Add Key**

* Back at your terminal command line, run `git clone URLpathtoyourremoteprivaterepo.git .` (replacing "URLpathtoyourremoteprivaterepo" with the URL to the repository provided by the website)

* `cd` into the newly cloned directory

##Spin up ISLE containers!

* run `docker-compose up -d`

* run `docker exec yourApacheContainerNameHere bash` (replace 993845754398)
use the name from the docker-composer.yml file here (typical: isle-apache-prod, or -stage, etc...)

cd to   `cd /tmp/isle_drupal_build_tools`

then run:
`./apache_provision.sh`

give this a few minutes and check the site - should be up now!
