ISLE also bundles together the best shared modules into a common, production-ready and security-hardened platform.\n\n\nWhy is it needed?\n\n\nIslandora is a powerful digital repository comprised of more than 80 different open-source software libraries. This complex ecosystem makes Islandora difficult and expensive to install, maintain and customize. ISLE lowers the barrier to entry for new schools while allowing existing members to reallocate funds towards development or ingestion instead of maintenance.\n\n\nHow can you help?\n\n\nISLE is seeking support from the Islandora community to see the project through. This support can take several forms, depending on your institution's resources and ability to contribute. To help ISLE succeed, you can:\n\n Contribute time to testing or development\n\n Contribute funding to enable more MVP Wishlist items or towards Phase II for CLAW\n\n Tell others about ISLE\n\n Add your institution to the \nISLE Supporters\n to express your interest in adopting the finished product (this helps show community interest)\n\n\nContributors welcome!\n\n\n\n\nIf you have questions, please contact \nDavid Keiser-Clark\n or post them on the \nIslandora listserv\n.",
